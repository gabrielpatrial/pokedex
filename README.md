# My Pokedex
This is a sample project -- use it at your own risk.

# The Code
This entire project was written in Objective-C on Xcode over the course of approximately 12 hours.
It makes use of the open PokemonApi -> https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2

I am more than happy to explain my line of thinking behind this project, my overall code structure, places that I have failed, places that I know I can improve, places I think I did well, etc.

This is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a complete project.
